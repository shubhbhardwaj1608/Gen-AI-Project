# Gen-AI-Project
Ask questions in plain English. Get real-time answers and visualizations from your SQL Server database.  This project connects Googleâ€™s Gemini AI with a Streamlit web app and SQL Server. It translates natural language queries into SQL, executes them using pyodbc, and visualizes the results with Plotly.
